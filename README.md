**Discrete Emotions Detection on Social Media: A Systematic Review and Comparative Analysis**

**Overview**

This research provides a systematic review and comparative analysis of analytical tools used for discrete emotions detection on social media. By examining nearly 2,000 studies conducted over the past decade, we identify the most prevalent tools, compare their performance against a human-annotated benchmark, and discuss their strengths, limitations, and potential applications in social and psychological research.

**Key Findings**

**Tools Reviewed:**

- Lexicon-based: NRC EmoLex, LIWC, Text2Emotion
- Deep learning-based: IBM NLU
- AI language model: ChatGPT-4

**Performance Summary:**

- IBM NLU demonstrated the highest performance in both sentiment analysis and discrete emotions detection.
- Lexicon-based tools were less accurate but showed specific strengths, such as LIWC's precision in predicting anxiety.
- ChatGPT-4 exhibited high precision but struggled with recall in diverse emotion detection.

**Benchmark:**

- Tools were tested against GoEmotions, a human-annotated dataset validated by Google Research, featuring 58,000 social media posts categorized into 27 discrete emotions.

**Limitations and Future Directions**

- This study focused on five analytical tools. Future research could explore additional tools like MeaningCloud and ParallelDots, commonly used in commercial contexts.
- Rapid advancements in AI suggest the need to evaluate emerging tools, including OpenAI's latest models, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini.
- Enhancing the alignment of AI-based tools with psychologically defined emotions remains a critical avenue for researc
